# C++ Functions Application

## 📌 Description

This is a C++ application I developed as part of a personal project to showcase my programming skills. The codebase contains around **1400 lines of code**, written using the **Dev-C++** compiler.

The main objective of the application is to demonstrate solid understanding of **functions** in C++, along with features like a **basic login system** and structured user interaction.

Throughout this project, I focused on applying good programming practices, including **modular design** and the use of **efficient data structures**, making the code easier to read, maintain, and scale.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Simple and user-friendly interface** – Designed for ease of use with clear options and flow.
- **Functional modularity** – Organized in reusable and logical function blocks.
- **Login system** – Basic implementation of a user access system.
- **Efficient logic** – Optimized performance for different user interactions.
- **Compiler compatibility** – Built using **Dev-C++**, compatible with any environment supporting standard C++.

## 🛠 Requirements

- C++ compiler (recommended: **Dev-C++**, **g++**, or **MSVC**)
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., Dev-C++, Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks)

## 📁 How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `.cpp` file(s) in your preferred IDE or text editor.
3. Compile and run the project using your C++ compiler.
